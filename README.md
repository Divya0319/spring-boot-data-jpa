# Spring Boot Data JPA
A demo Spring boot app built using Spring Data JPA, which minimized significant boilerplate code from JPA.

It performs CRUD operations based on endpoints, and using HTTP methods, GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

The application has no frontend portion, just the backend, returning data in the form of JSON, or if some error occurs, it throws the exception.
